Policy is a statement of intent, which provides guidance for implementation of processes and procedures in an organization. Policies can be at organization/local level or at the government/center level and may have legal bindings. The government level policies take precedence over the organization policies. Institutional mechanism is required to ensure compliance of policies in an organization. The policies are the guiding document for decision making processes in an organization.

Policy is one of the most important factors and forms the basis of interoperability. Following are interoperability recommendations for the policy factor.

| ID | Recommendations |
| :---- | :---- |
| **POL\#1**| Identify policies in your organization/country related to data and services and conduct periodic check/audit for compliance to these policies. Identify policies which may be barriers to interoperability of data and services and flag them for resolution. |
| **POL\#2** | **CEOS MIM Database:** Publish and periodically update Information about present and planned Earth observation Satellites in [CEOS MIM Database](https://ceos.org/mim-database) .This will help in planning and overall coordination among different EO stakeholders. |
| **POL\#3** | **Open Standards:** Ensure your organizations implement open standards such as those published by the OGC for data and services in preference to drafting new specifications for data formats, metadata formats and service APIs. |
| **POL\#4** | **Open Data:** Organizations should ensure that the non-commercial Earth observation data is proactively made freely available for use, reuse and redistribution to users in human and machine readable form. |
| **POL\#5** | **Open Source Software:** Where possible, share software applications as open source software, enabling others to use the same tools as are used internally to process or transform data products or to demonstrate the use of standards to access your data and services. |
| **POL\#6** | **Open Science:** Promote the concept of open science for collaborative development. Open science ensures availability of the state-of-the-art algorithms and software providing consistent products from different data providers and supporting reproducibility. |
| **POL\#7** | **CEOS Best Practices:** Ensure your organization complies with the CEOS Best Practices to pursue and facilitate Interoperability.  |
| **POL\#8** | **Data Licensing:** Organizations sharing open and unrestricted data should license the data using one of the following data license a) Creative Commons Zero 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication (CCo) b) Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License (PDDL) v1.0 c) Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0). The Custom license agreement should not be used, and these standard licenses should not be moidifed or augmented with additional text as per [GEO data licensing Guidance](<https://gkhub.earthobservations.org/packages/p0zg8-02b56>)|
