Quality informs users of the trustworthiness of Earth Observation data and products and to provides a forum for the exchange of information about calibration and validation, including the coordination of cooperative activities.

## Calibration and Validation

Calibration is the process of quantitatively defining a systemâ€™s response to known and controlled signal inputs. Validation, on the other hand, is the process of assessing, by independent means, the quality of the data products derived from those system outputs.

## Cal/Val Recommendations

| **ID** | **Recommendations** |
| :---- | :---- |
| **CALVAL\#1** | CEOS CAL/VAL portal can be used as a reference site for insuring interoperability for calibration and validation: https://calvalportal.ceos.org/ |
| **CALVAL\#2** | CEOS/WGCV developed Data Quality Assurance Strategy should be followed for ensuring interoperability |
| **CALVAL\#3** | CEOS endorsed Cal/Val sites should be used for satellite cross-comparison: https://calvalportal.ceos.org/calvalsites | 
| **CALVAL\#4** | CEOS ARD Framework should be used as a starting point for development of Analysis Ready Data |
| **CALVAL\#5** | CEOS Product Family Specifications (PFS) should be used for development of ARD products. In case if a new ARD is to be developed, use PFS template and submit to CEOS for approval |
| **CALVAL\#6** | CEOS ARD compliance of the product requires two level of assessments, first is self assessment (CEOS ARD Self Assessment Guide) and second is peer review by CEOS Experts |
| **CALVAL\#7** | The Joint Agency Commercial Imagery Evaluation (JACIE) Best Practices document can be used as a guideline for standard calibration and validation activites to be performed: https://www.usgs.gov/publications/joint-agency-commercial-imagery-evaluation-jacie-best-practices-remote-sensing-system |
| **CALVAL\#8** | The ESA Earth Data Assessment Project (EDAP) process provides multiple reporting metrics related to quality: https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/activities/edap |
