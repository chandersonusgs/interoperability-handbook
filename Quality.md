Quality informs users of the trustworthiness of Earth Observation data and products and to provides a forum for the exchange of information about calibration and validation, including the coordination of cooperative activities.

## Calibration and Validation

Calibration is the process of quantitatively defining a systemâ€™s response to known and controlled signal inputs. Validation, on the other hand, is the process of assessing, by independent means, the quality of the data products derived from those system outputs.

## Cal/Val Recommendations

| **ID** | **Recommendations** |
| :---- | :---- |
| **CALVAL\#1** | CEOS CAL/VAL portal can be used as a reference site for insuring interoperability for calibration and validation |
| **CALVAL\#2** | CEOS/WGCV developed Data Quality Assurance Strategy should be followed for ensuring interoperability |
| **CALVAL\#3** | CEOS endorsed Cal/Val sites should be used for satellite cross-comparison |
| **CALVAL\#9** | Measurand and Uncertainty of stated values within products are key to understanding data quality |
